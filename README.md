🌐🖥️ I built my own web browser… in Python.

Not Chrome. Not Firefox. Just pure Python, curiosity, and a little bit of hacker spirit. 🐍⚡

Introducing Johnny Mini Browser
 — a lightweight, functional browser that can:

🌍 Load and render basic web pages

🔗 Navigate back and forward

🕹️ Keep history of visited pages

🖼️ (Optional) Render simple images and styled text

💡 Why it’s cool:

A hands-on exploration of how browsers work under the hood

Lightweight, no dependencies beyond Python

Perfect playground for learning HTML parsing, HTTP requests, and GUI rendering

💬 Imagine learning the fundamentals of the web… by building your own browser. That’s what this project is all about.
